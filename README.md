# FakeNewsDetectorByMark

This solution uses two of the state-of-the-art pre-trained models in natural language processing, BERT and GPT-3, to classify news articles as either real or fake.

The BERT model is used to fine-tune a pre-trained language model to classify news articles as real or fake, based on a labeled dataset. The fine-tuned BERT model is then used to predict the labels of new news articles.

In addition, the repository also contains code that uses the GPT-3 model to summarize the prediction of the BERT model for a given news article. This summary can be useful to quickly understand the prediction of the BERT model and to verify its accuracy.

The code in the repository is written in Python and uses PyTorch as the deep learning framework. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it accessible to both novice and experienced machine learning practitioners.

Overall, the "Fake News Detector"  provides a robust and effective solution for detecting fake news using pre-trained language models.
